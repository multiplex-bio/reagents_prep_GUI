# GUI to help users to run the protocols used in PNRSV diagnostics with Opentrons

This app is intended to provide help to the scientist that will run the protocols used in our laboratory.

The user can interact with the app so they can select the protocol they want to run (TNA, RT or qPCRT) and the app will help them in the following ways:

- The app will show how much reagent should be used for aech protocol
- The app will show where each reagent should be placed, either within the robot and within the labwares that will be used.
